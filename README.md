# employee-availability-form
The Employee Availability Submission System is a responsive web-based form that allows employees to submit their weekly availability online. The system captures personal details, unavailable hours, and additional notes, then securely sends the data to an email endpoint using Formspree.

The application includes client-side validation to ensure required fields are completed correctly, stores submitted data in the browser using localStorage for persistence, and provides instant visual feedback with a success message—without reloading the page.

This project demonstrates practical form handling, validation, third-party API integration, and modern JavaScript event management.
